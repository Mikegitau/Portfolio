Realistic fiction centered on a Pakistani-American Muslim girl is
 a refreshing change in the middle grade market.....Itâ€™s solid storyline
 and the common denominator of middle school drama highlights the fact
 that students from all backgrounds may be more alike than they realize.

I was surprised to read the accounts of Dr. Ben Carson.
 His mother had a strong stamina in raising her two boys with such a positive attitude. 
She is my all time mentor. With hard work, and 
complete trust in God we all can accomplish what God has planned for us in our lives.
 She is a true example of an incredible faith. Dr. Carson is a one on a kind, as he was
 so honest is sharing his story, He is the unspoken hero that took many years of hard 
work to develop his talents, yet our God gave him and his wife a marriage union that
 held them though all circumstances., One thing I will take with me from this book is
 the power that God gives us with total faith in Him. My thanks Dr. Carson for a truly 
wonderful book that was well worth reading.
